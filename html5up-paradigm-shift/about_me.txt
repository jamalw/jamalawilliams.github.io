My work focuses on the computational and neural mechanisms underlying human memory and perception, particularly as they relate to music. My research employs music as a naturalistic stimulus to investigate how the brain processes, segments, and recalls complex auditory experiences, offering insights into broader questions of event perception and memory formation.

I earned my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Princeton University in 2023, where I had the privilege of working with Kenneth Norman, Uri Hasson, and Elizabeth Margulis. My doctoral research focused on the neural dynamics of music event segmentation and music-evoked memory reactivation, using advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and computational modeling to unravel how music can trigger and organize memory processes.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Josh McDermott. My postdoctoral work explores the computational principles underlying musical expectation and prediction, aiming to understand how the brain generates, updates, and responds to auditory expectations.

My research combines cutting-edge brain imaging methods with rigorous computational modeling to advance our understanding of the neural coding of complex, temporally structured stimuli. I am particularly interested in how these processes relate to broader questions of perception, memory consolidation, and prediction. I aim to contribute to the field by developing computational models that can bridge the gap between neural activity and the rich, dynamic process of listening to and recalling musical experiences.

I am committed to building a research program that not only advances theoretical understanding but also fosters interdisciplinary collaboration across cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling, and the study of naturalistic stimuli. My goal is to contribute to an academic environment that values innovation, diversity, mentorship, and the pursuit of knowledge at the intersection of neuroscience and cognitive science.

In my spare time, Iâ€™m an avid musician, producer, and DJ, and I also enjoy film and traveling.
